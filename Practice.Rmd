# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r label = "pressure", echo=FALSE, fig.width= 4, fig.height= 4, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Put something interesting or informative here"}
plot(pressure, col = "blue", pch = 19)
```

$\bar{X} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{X_i}{n}$

The average pressure for the `pressure` data frame `r round(mean(pressure$pressure), 2)` mm.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Jared are you here?

The sample mean is defined in Equation \@ref(eq:mean).

\begin{equation}
\bar{X} = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{X_i}{n}
(\#eq:mean)
\end{equation}

Please refer to Figure \@ref(fig:pressure).
